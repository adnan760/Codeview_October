# üå¶Ô∏è Weather App
A  Python Weather App that connects to a OpenWeather API and provides real-time weather data. 

Here's how it works:
- API Integration:
Integrated the requests library to connect to a weather API, fetching live weather data for user-specified locations with a provided API key.
- User-Friendly GUI (Tkinter):
Developed a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
Included input fields for location and a "Fetch Weather" button to initiate data retrieval.
- Data Retrieval and Display:
When users click "Fetch Weather," the app processes the API response to retrieve temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
Displays this information in the GUI for the user to see.
- Error Handling:
Implemented error handling to gracefully handle scenarios where users enter an invalid location or when the API call fails.

This project demonstrates effective API integration, GUI design, data processing, and error handling skills, providing a practical application for real-time weather information.
