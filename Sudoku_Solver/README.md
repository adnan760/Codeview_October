# ðŸ§© Sudoku Solver
A Python-based Sudoku solver using a backtracking approach.

Here's how I did it step by step:
1. Define the Sudoku Board:
I started by defining the Sudoku board as a 9x9 grid using a 2D list in Python. Empty cells are represented by 0, and given numbers were filled in.

2. Created Helper Functions:
I created helper functions:print_board(board): to visually print the Sudoku board for better visualization.
find_empty_cell(board): to find the first empty cell (cell with a value of 0) in the Sudoku board. 
is_valid_move(board, row, col, num): to validate if a number can be placed in a certain cell according to Sudoku rules.

3. Implemented Backtracking Algorithm:
I implemented the backtracking algorithm using a recursive function called solve_sudoku(board). It attempts to place numbers in empty cells and backtracks when encountering invalid moves.

4. Printed the Solved Puzzle:
Finally, I called the solve_sudoku function with the Sudoku board and printed the solved puzzle using the print_board function.

This task showcases the problem-solving skills and algorithmic proficiency.
