# üìù To-Do List App
A Python To-Do List application that enables users to manage tasks efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
- Add a New Task:
  Users can add tasks to the to-do list. The add_todo() function captures user input and appends the task description to the list.

- View and Manage Tasks:
The view_todos() function displays tasks along with their completion status. Users can mark tasks as completed, removing them from the list, or remove tasks directly.

- Task Completion:
Users can mark tasks as completed using the complete_todo() function. The completion status is tracked using a boolean flag in the task dictionary.

- Remove a Task:
Tasks can be removed from the list using the remove_todo() function. Users specify the task number, and the selected task is removed.

- Task Statistics:
The show_statistics() function provides an overview of the total tasks, completed tasks, and remaining tasks.

This application demonstrates the fundamentals of Python programming, including user input handling, list manipulation, and conditional statements.
